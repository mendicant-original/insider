#RMU-Insider#

These have been some interesting weeks.

For starters, we had our first official meeting! The topic was a group review of the different RMU entrance exam submissions. It was decided that the session would be public, so the [transcript is available](http://gist.github.com/467714) (thanks to [Pete Higgins](http://beginrescue.blogspot.com/)), along with [the solutions](http://github.com/rmu/rmu-entrance-exam-2010) that were discussed.

With that out of the way, it's time for the big announcements.

##August Pilot Program##

Everybody who signed up for the pilot program, listen up. All students need to have their projects **approved before August 1st**. This will allow Gregory to plan the material around the problems that you'll be likely to find, as well as ensure that the session will begin smoothly.

There aren't any hard rules on the project that you may select, but keep in mind that meaningful progress is expected during the three week period. Also, if you're interested in a team project, keep it below three people so there's work for everyone.

If possible, send a free-form description of your project soon by private email to Gregory &mdash; it's the best way to discuss it.

##RMUers##

I want to bring to your attention the current projects/material available to you:


* Brad Cantin's [opensourceitwith.me](http://opensourceitwith.me/) project. Show him some love!
* Resources for [Writing Better Tests](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-mendicant-university----general/web/writing-better-tests), mantained by Stuart Ellis.
* A list of [Great Books to Read](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-mendicant-university----general/web/rmu-summer-reading-list), as well as (shameless plug alert!) a list of [Online Programming Books](http://suicidalpanda.com/books).
* The definitive list of [Focus Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-mendicant-university----general/web/focus-groups?version=10).


So far as focus groups are concerned, we're about to begin week 4 of the *Remote Pair-Programming* sessions (thanks again, [Anita Kuno](http://www.twitter.com/anteaya)!), as well as week 1 of the *Code Reading* sessions (merci beaucoup, Felipe Doria).

Last, but not least, remember to join us at #rmu-general @ freenode.net.
